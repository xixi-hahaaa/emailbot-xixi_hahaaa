This project is a personalized email bot designed to streamline the management of hydro bill payments and reminders. Hereâ€™s an overview of its functionality:

1. **Email Integration with Gmail API:** The bot utilizes the Google Gmail API to connect to your Gmail account, fetch incoming hydro bill emails, and process them for further actions.

2. **Discord Integration:** Built using the `discord.py` library, the bot interacts with users via Discord. It sends notifications and reminders about outstanding bills, allows users to mark bills as paid, and provides an interface for viewing all unpaid bills.

3. **Reminders and Notifications:** The bot automates reminders for outstanding hydro bills and sends timely notifications to users through Discord. It helps ensure that bills are paid on time and tracks payment statuses.

4. **MySQL Connectivity:** The bot connects to a MySQL database to store and manage data related to hydro bills, including payment statuses and historical records. It uses this data to provide insights and update records as necessary.

5. **Data Analysis:** The bot includes functionality for analyzing hydro bill trends. It can generate visualizations and perform data analysis to track usage patterns, predict future costs, and help users understand their billing history.

6. **Current Project Focus:** This project serves as a learning platform to understand data science principles and explore AI/ML concepts. It involves practical applications of data analysis and automated notifications, providing a hands-on approach to learning these fields. As well, other potential important emails can be tracked and analyzed by the bot. Future updates should also include reminders for shared subscription reminders and school email integration.
